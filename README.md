# HTTP-1.1-Lib

A Go library implementing HTTP/1.1 protocol from scratch, designed for learning and understanding the protocol's inner workings.

## üìã Overview

This educational project aims to:
- Implement HTTP/1.1 protocol from the ground up
- Provide insights into the protocol's complexities
- Serve as a learning resource for HTTP protocol internals.
- Document the journey on step by step implementation of how one can implement the HTTP/1.1 protocol for their own learning.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.x or higher
